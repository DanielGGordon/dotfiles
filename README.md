# dotfiles
They're dotfiles

## This is a WIP
My dotfiles are spread across several machines. I am currently compiling them to all be in this repo. 
As of writing, several dotfiles are not here - mainly, my bash profile settings.

## Scripts
There are a few small scripts available for installing very basic packages like pathogen and vim-airline.

### Use at your own risk. I offer no warranty. 
However, I am happy to hear feedback or proposals for changes.
